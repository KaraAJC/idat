who dat, **YOU DAT!!** Your Daily Dose of Dopeness: IDAT (AKA: I Did A Thing)

## About This Project:
IDAT is a daily dose of awesome things made by Queer, Trans, Non-Binary folks who are Black or Non-Black People Of Color!

You'll be able to Amplify their work, Celebrate their achievement, and Support them financially or any way they see fit.

IDAT was an Idea that sprang out of my participation in the [2017 Write/Speak/Code](https://2017.writespeakcode.org) Conference in Portland, OR. As an alumnx of the conference, we were tasked with coming up with and working on a project. By that time, we were on day two of the conference, and I'd already seen and referred to SO MANY amazing things that fellow QBPOC and QNBPOC have done, that I wanted to build something that would share them year round.

### Goals:
The goal of IDAT is to collect and distribute all the things, from zines and twitter threads, to presentations, github projects, and other accomplishments of all sizes and deliver them to an audience who wants to share, support, contribute, buy, and celebrate that work, while giving a short 24-hr timeframe on it.

Right now, I'm seeking Creators to share the things they've made so I can collect enough to buffer out a great month's worth schedule of things to share, and I'm building out the distribution channels via Tiny Letter and a website, that will show a given thing for a 24-hr span, and let subscribers Buy, Share, or Support the creator.

I'm also building out a Twitter bot named IDATbot to be a source for creators and fans to let me know about more things to put on the schedule.
